Planning stage:
Tetris has a grid,

where pieces are constantly moving down until they hit the bottom of the grid,

pieces have a different shapes, and can be moved left, right or down, and can be rotated,

pieces stop moving when they touch the bottom of the grid or hit another piece that's already there.

When the current piece stops, next one comes randomly. (I also need to build a preview so the player can see the next piece coming.)

Each piece is composed of 4 small squares.

When a piece lands and forms a solid line, the row disappears.

When the row disappears all other squares move down until they touch the bottom of the grid.

need to create:
1. a grid
2. shapes:
    single square shape
    block square
    long rectangle
    S shape
    bump shape
3. make the shapes move down and across the grid.
4. handle user keystrokes
